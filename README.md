## Motivation

Iâ€™m not doing this to create a portfolio or for external validation. I simply enjoy the satisfaction of completing something, similar to achieving 100% in a game. I also love coding and the learning process. My goal is to work through all the problems on LeetCode, improving my skills as I go. I focus on enjoying the journey and learning at my own pace rather than stressing myself out.

> This repository idea was inspired by my [GeeksforGeeks solutions repository](https://github.com/Runarok). You can view the solutions [here](https://github.com/Runarok/GeeksForGeeks-solutions).
