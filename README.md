# LeetCode Solutions Repository üìö

This repository contains solutions to various problems from LeetCode. The solutions are organized by difficulty and problem categories, allowing easy access to each problem's solution.

## Motivation üí°

I‚Äôm not doing this to create a portfolio or for external validation. I simply enjoy the satisfaction of completing something, similar to achieving 100% in a game. I also love coding and the learning process. My goal is to work through all the problems on LeetCode, improving my skills as I go. I focus on enjoying the journey and learning at my own pace rather than stressing myself out.

> This repository idea was inspired by my [GeeksforGeeks solutions repository](https://github.com/Runarok). You can view the solutions [here](https://github.com/Runarok/GeeksForGeeks-solutions).

## Automation for Uploads ü§ñ

The upload of solutions to this repository was automated using a Chrome extension called [LeetSync](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/leetsync-leetcode-to-gith/ppkbejeolfcbaomanmbpjdbkfcjfhjnd). This extension streamlines the process of saving solutions to GitHub.  
> The Open Source Repository used for automation is available at [LeetSync](https://github.com/LeetSync/LeetSync).

## Extension Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è

The main issue I faced with this extension is that it was not as good as the GeeksforGeeks extension. There were a lot more steps needed to update the solutions, and I had to rerun the process a lot more than expected. This made the process a bit frustrating at times.

## Extra Grind Attempt üîß

For extra grind, I decided to try coding and getting answers in every programming language available on LeetCode. However, the issues with the extension made this challenge borderline unenjoyable. I attempted to do this for one program: [Two Sum](https://github.com/Runarok/LeetSolutions/tree/main/Solutions/1-two-sum). It took me about 1 hour to code it in 80% of the available programming languages, and that too for a relatively easy question. 

Because of these difficulties, I‚Äôm leaving this challenge behind and will update solutions day by day until I complete the GeeksforGeeks 100%.  

If you require an answer for any question in any coding language, feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/Runarok/LeetSolutions/issues).
